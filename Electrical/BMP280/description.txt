The GY-BMP280 module comes with BMP280 sensor, which is an environmental sensor with temperature, barometric pressure that is the next generation upgrade to the BMP085/BMP180/BMP183.
This sensor is great for all sorts of weather sensing and can even be used in both I2C and SPI.
This precision sensor is the best low-cost, precision sensing solution for measuring barometric pressure with ±1 hPa absolute accuracy, and temperature with ±1.0°C accuracy. Because pressure changes with altitude and the pressure measurements are so good, you can also use it as an altimeter with ±1 meter accuracy
Pin pitch: 2.54mm
Module size: 11.5mm*15mm
