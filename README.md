# Project Overview

## üåç Introduction
EcoMaros is a CanSat project developed for the European Space Agency‚Äôs CanSat competition. Our mission was to design, build, and launch a fully functional satellite the size of a soda can, carrying out both a **primary mission** (measuring atmospheric temperature and pressure) and a **secondary mission** (environmental air quality analysis).

Our CanSat was launched from a rocket, reaching an altitude of approximately **1 km** before descending via parachute while continuously transmitting data to our ground station. The data collected was analyzed to extract valuable scientific insights and improve future small-satellite designs.
