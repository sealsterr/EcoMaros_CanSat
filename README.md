# Project Overview

## üåç Introduction  
EcoMaros is a CanSat project developed for the European Space Agency‚Äôs CanSat competition. Our mission was to design, build, and launch a fully functional satellite the size of a soda can, carrying out both a **primary mission** (measuring atmospheric temperature and pressure) and a **secondary mission** (environmental air quality analysis).  

Our CanSat was launched from a rocket, reaching an altitude of approximately **1 km** before descending via parachute while continuously transmitting data to our ground station. The data collected was analyzed to extract valuable scientific insights and improve future small-satellite designs.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Mission Objectives  

### ‚úÖ **Primary Mission:**

### üåø **Secondary Mission:**  
- **Analyze air quality parameters** by measuring pollutants such as CO, CO‚ÇÇ, NO‚ÇÇ, and VOC levels.  
- **Monitor altitude-based variations** in air quality and correlate with temperature/pressure.  
- **Evaluate sensor efficiency** and compare with standardized environmental datasets.  
- **Capture high-resolution video footage** during descent using an onboard camera, providing visual data to complement sensor readings and assist in post-mission analysis.

# Software Architecture

## Microcontroller Code
The firmware running on the microcontroller handles sensor data acquisition, processing, and transmission. Key functionalities include:
- Initialization of sensors and communication protocols.
  
  ```c
  void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
  
    // initialize modules
    init_radio_module();
    init_bmp_module();
    init_mpu_module();
    init_mq_module();
    init_sd_card();
    init_gnss_module();
  }
  ```
  
- Real-time data acquisition and processing.

  ```c
  sensors_event_t a; // m/s^2
  sensors_event_t g; // rad/s
  sensors_event_t temp; // C

  mpu.getEvent(&a, &g, &temp);

  sTim_t date = gnss.getDate(); // Date
  sTim_t utc = gnss.getUTC(); // UTC Time
  sLonLat_t lat = gnss.getLat(); // Latitude
  sLonLat_t lon = gnss.getLon(); // Longitude
  double high = gnss.getAlt(); // Altitude - m
  double cog = gnss.getCog(); // Course over Ground - Degrees
  double sog = gnss.getSog() * 0.514; // Speed over Ground - m/s

  float temperature = bmp.readTemperature(); // C
  float pressure = bmp.readPressure() / 100; // hPa
  float altitude = bmp.readAltitude(1015.24); // m
  float airquality = analogRead(11); // PPM

  float gforce = sqrt((a.acceleration.x * a.acceleration.x) + (a.acceleration.y * a.acceleration.y) + (a.acceleration.z * a.acceleration.z)) - 11;
  // after testing we found that during a state of rest the sensor measured 11G's, so we removed the constant positive G-Force to maintain correct data measurement
  ```
  
- Transmission of telemetry data.

  ```c
  String packet_str = "";
  packet_str.concat(String(String(packetnum, DEC) + ","));
  packet_str.concat(String(lat.latitudeDegree, 6) + ",");
  packet_str.concat(String(lon.lonitudeDegree, 6) + ",");
  packet_str.concat(String(high, 1) + ",");
  ```

## Ground Station Software
The ground station software receives telemetry data and prints it on the Serial Monitor, adding an additional RSSI value.

```c
// print received data with added RSSI value
buf[len] = 0;

Serial.print("$");
Serial.print(rf69.lastRssi(), DEC);
Serial.print(",");
Serial.print((char*)buf);
Serial.print("\r\n");
```

## Data Processing
Data is stored in a `DATALOG.txt` file, every line representing a value, with a comma as separator. This enables us to use Microsoft Excel to organise data in a more friendly environment, making it compatible with our **Ground Processing Software**.

- **CanSat measurement format:**
```
Packet Number, Date, Time, Course over Ground, Speed over Ground, Temperature, Pressure, Air Quality, Latitude, Longitude, GPS Altitude, Accelerometer X-Y-Z & Gyroscope X-Y-Z, G-Force, BMP Altitude
```

- **Telemetry format:**
```
RSSI, Packet Number, Latitude, Longitude, GPS Altitude
```

- **Ground Processing Software:**
  
  In order to visualise and interpret incoming and stored data, our team decided to use [Serial Studio](https://github.com/Serial-Studio/Serial-Studio). This program enables us to record, replay and store incoming data, making post-launch data analysis much easier to conduct. During Serial Studio setup, we have to specify which "preset" we want to use. We have created two custom JSON files:

1. `ground_station_live.json`
  - Used during the CanSat competition launch, designed to receive and visualise telemetry data.\
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbb7d6a8-1102-4d99-b409-d3c9db9a8bfe)
2. `ground_station_playback.json`
  - Crucial for documentation and post-launch data showcase.
  - Played a crucial role when presenting our measured data to the jury.\
